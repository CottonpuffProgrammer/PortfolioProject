        <h2>What are HTML Comments?</h2>
        <p>
            HTML comments are used to add notes or explanations within your HTML code. 
            They are not displayed on the webpage itself, but they can help developers understand the code, leave reminders, 
            or temporarily disable sections of the code during development.
        </p>
        <p>Purposes of HTML Comments:</p>
        <ul>
            Documentation:
            <li>HTML comments allow developers to add explanations or instructions within the code. 
                This is useful for clarifying complex sections of the code or leaving notes for other developers working on the same project.</li>

            <br />

            Temporarily Disable Code:
            <li>You can use comments to temporarily disable part of the HTML code without deleting it. 
                This is helpful when testing or troubleshooting.</li>

            <br />

            Organizing Code:
            <li>Comments can help break the code into sections, making it easier to read and navigate. This is especially useful in larger projects with lots of code.</li>

            <br />

            Notes for Future Development:
            <li>You can add reminders or TODOs in your comments for future work or improvements.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            As stated above, HTML comments are used to leave notes or explanations in the code that won't be displayed on the webpage. 
            They are helpful for documentation, organizing code, temporarily disabling elements, and leaving reminders. 
            While they are invisible to users, they make it easier for developers to collaborate and maintain the code.
